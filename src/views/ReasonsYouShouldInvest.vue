              Of course, this is the profound reason every investor buys stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Long-term equity returns have always been more beneficial than
              returns from cash and bonds. Nevertheless, stock prices seem to
              rise and fall over time. Therefore, most investors favor a
              long-term perspective for their equity portfolio because
              stock-market fluctuations smooth over long periods.
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold">
              Done right, you stand to manifold your investment by approximately
              7% to 10% per year in the long run.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, suppose you invested $10,000 into the stock market.
              The stock value grows by 7% per year. In 10 years, you would have
              raised your 10,000 dollars into 20,000 dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, suppose you invested 10,000 dollars every year for 30
              years. If you calculate, you would have invested 300,000 dollars
              into the stock. Surprisingly, you would have gained 1,010,730. An
              interest of 710,730 dollars. You would have been a millionaire
              without even lifting a finger.

              Don't get me wrong. Money is BAe. On the other hand, cash is
              trash. The main reason is inflation. Inflation is the slow but
              steady force that impels prices to rise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well, think of how much stuff you would have bought in 1900 with
              just 1 dollar. Try that now and see what you get(perhaps a slap
              from the salesperson).

              If your grandfather had bought treasury bonds or put his money in
              a Certificate of Deposit at his local bank. He'd earn just enough
              to avoid inflation. In Us, the best CD rate is around 2.7%
              annually. But suppose he'd wisely bought stocks offering an annual
              return of 7% discussed earlier.
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold">Wow, isn't CASH TRASH?</p>
            <p>
              Once again, adopt a long-term perspective for your equity
              portfolio because stock-market fluctuations smooth over long
              periods.
            </p>

            3.Invest in Stocks Because Historically, They Have Gone Up

          <div class="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Historically, stock prices tend to rise in the long run. There
              have been cruddy crashes, drawbacks, and periods of poor
              performance. However, stocks tend to form a steady march upward as
              the economies grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you had merely one single dollar invested in the
              shares of small companies in 1926, you would be worth
              approximately 40,000 dollars today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most investors invest in stocks since they believe the market will
              thrive over time.

              The bedrock is that if you earn a regular return on your
              investments over a long time (let's say 10, 20, 30, or more
              years), that investment manifolds in a way seemingly unimaginable.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've seen how you would invest 10,000 dollars yearly with an
              annual return of 7% to reap an astounding return of $710,730.

            <p>Let us dive deeper and consider a longer timeline.</p>
            <p>
              Suppose you invested 10,000 dollars every year for 60 years
              instead of 30. Your yearly investment of merely 10,000 dollars
              would have grown to an incredible $8,104,668!

            5. Invest in Stocks Because You'll Earn Much More Than Other
            Investments
          </h3>
          <div class="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Historically, investors have benefited a great deal from stocks
              more than other investment options. The returns are incomparable
              to investing in bonds and treasury bills.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, one amazing rival to stocks is the real state. Research
              shows that investing in real estate could return nearly the same
              as stocks in the long run.
            </p>

            6. Invest In Stocks Because They Are Easy To Understand and, Invest
          </h3>
          <div class="space-y-3">
            <p>
              If you are blessed enough to possess a substantial amount of
              money, you will likely encounter difficulty determining where to
              invest. So many ideas are desirable. For example, you could invest
              in real estate, invest in bonds, start a business, or yet invest
              in precious coins.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then again, stocks are lenient to invest. You need to sign up with
              an online trading broker like
              <a href="https://fidelity.com/">Fidelity</a>,
              <a href="https://vanguard.com">Vanguard</a>,
              <a href="https://etrade.com">E*TRADE</a>, or
              <a href="https://schwab.com/">Charles Schwab</a>, learn the
              basics, and savvy some practical experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared to real investing in real estate or business, the
              learning curve for stocks is low. Stocks are also cheap to trade
              relative to other investments. It's no surprise stocks are
              referred to as "liquid assets" since stocks can be easily turned
              into cash.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suppose you invested $1,000 in the stock market at 9 am. Then at 3
              pm, you decide to cash out. You only need a few clicks then you
              will have turned that thousand dollars into cash.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comparatively, illiquid assets can not be easily converted to
              cash. For example, suppose you had a Maserati that you needed to
              convert to cash. Depending on your marketing strategies, you could
              use up weeks or months hunting the right buyer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many investors invest in stocks since they can cash out easily if
              need be.

              The government has furnished various tax-free accounts that allow
              you to legally avoid tax on your investments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Avoiding taxes make a clear-cut difference in how much money you
              earn from your investments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the more money you invest, the more you gain from
              tax-free investments. However, you typically have to invest in
              stocks or similar investments such as mutual funds or Exchange
              Traded Funds (ETFs).
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally, if you trade your stock at a loss the government will
              give you a tax break. If you trade your stock at a profit, you
              will have to pay a small fee called capital gains taxes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some governments offer complete leniency on dividend stocks.
              Therefore, you will not incur any tax cut on your investments.

              It's often wise to avoid placing all eggs in the same basket.
              Stocks allow you to diversify your investments.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, suppose you have a full-time job, do handy work on

              student, and invest in dividend stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you were to injure your right hand such that you could not do
              handy work on the weekends, you wouldn't lose your income. The
              other two sources of income would still help you pull through.

              The same concept applies to stocks. Diversification helps you
              invest in different assets to diffuse your risk. If one stock
              loses, the other stock brings in profits so that your entire
              portfolio is protected.

                Investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grants
                you the chance to own hundreds of stocks selected by the fund
                manager. One promiscuous way to diversify is through index funds
                or index ETFs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Diversify by Location.</span> Why
                not invest in a company in the United States, Europe, Japan,
                Kenya, and emerging markets? Diversifying allows you to curb the
                opportunity to take advantage of blooming economies without
                being vulnerable to any single geography.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Diversify by Company Size.</span>
                There are three types of companies based on size: small-cap,
                mid-cap, and large-cap(the term cap means capitalization).
                Capitalization is the total stock price multiplied by the number
                of shares. It's wise to consider different-sized companies when
                investing. Large-cap companies are stable and less open to
                sharing price volatility. Comparatively, small-cap companies are
                susceptible to share price volatility but offer more growth
                potential.

              Mainly, investors intend to buy low and then sell high. For
              example, investing in a fast-growing company. That's lucrative to
              both buy-and-hold investors and day traders. The first group
              intends to see the company's earnings and stock price bloom over
              time. The latter expects to capitalize on short-term trends. Both
              investors believe their stock analysis guarantees profits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, other investors opt for a steady stream of cash. These
              investors buy stocks of companies that give dividends. Generally,
              these companies grow at a moderate rate. However, not all
              companies offer dividends.
            </p>
            <p>
              So you can choose between investing in stocks at a low price and
              then cashing out with profits when the stock price grows. Or you
              can choose to buy stocks from companies that offer dividends.

                Stock prices can be very volatile, especially in small-cap
                companies. You could lose your entire investment when you are a
                day trader. Then again, consider buying and holding stocks over
                a long time since their graphs are generally smooth. Therefore,
                you will not have to stress about price fluctuations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Investing in stocks requires research which could use up a lot
                of time. When buying stocks on your own, you must scrutinize
                each company to find its chances of making a profit. Therefore,
                you need to learn how to analyze financial statements, and
                annual reports and follow the company's trends. You should also
                monitor the stock market. Any company, including the best, will
                fall into a market crash, correction, or bear market.
              </li>
              <li>
                Investing in stocks opens you up to competition from
                professionals. Professional traders and institutional traders
                have more time and wits in investing. These investors have
                advanced financial models, trading tools, and computer systems.

              Regardless of the risks involved, the best way to control your
              risks is by diversifying your investments. We have gone through

              Investing in stocks merely implies buying equity in a company. You

              fraction of the company. You can invest in stocks by buying
              fractional or whole shares of the company. Moreover, you can buy
              mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in

              How do you earn from investing in penny stocks?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Penny stocks are stocks that trade for 1 dollar per share or
              below. Small-cap companies own penny stocks with the hope of
              flourishing into large-cap companies. There is the potential to
              profit from that growth. However, there is also the risk that the
              company will not thrive or be insolent. Moreover, penny stocks
              rarely give dividends implying that you will earn returns through
              capital appreciation.

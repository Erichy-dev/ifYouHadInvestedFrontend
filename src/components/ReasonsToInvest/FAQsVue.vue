        What does it mean to invest in the stock market?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Investing in stocks merely implies buying equity in a company. You
        become a part owner of the company regardless of only owning a fraction
        of the company. You can invest in stocks by buying fractional or whole
        shares of the company. Moreover, you can buy mutual funds or
        exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in stocks.

        Is it safe to invest in the stock market?
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is absolutely no prodigy that can perfectly predict which way a
        stock will go. Therefore, there is always a chance that you profit or
        lose it all. In the main, the more money you invest, the higher your
        potential to gain or lose. The risk-profit ratio depends on the quality
        of your research and analysis.

        How do you earn from investing in penny stocks?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Penny stocks are stocks that trade for 1 dollar per share or below.
        Small-cap companies own penny stocks with the hope of flourishing into
        large-cap companies. There is the potential to profit from that growth.
        However, there is also the risk that the company will not thrive or be
        insolent. Moreover, penny stocks rarely give dividends implying that you
        will earn returns through capital appreciation.

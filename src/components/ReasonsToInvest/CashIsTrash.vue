        Don't get me wrong. Money is BAe. On the other hand, cash is trash. The
        main reason is inflation. Inflation is the slow but steady force that
        impels prices to rise.

        Well, think of how much stuff you would have bought in 1900 with just 1

        If your grandfather had bought treasury bonds or put his money in a
        Certificate of Deposit at his local bank. He'd earn just enough to avoid
        inflation. In Us, the best CD rate is around 2.7% annually. But suppose
        he'd wisely bought stocks offering an annual return of 7% discussed
        earlier.

        Once again, adopt a long-term perspective for your equity portfolio
        because stock-market fluctuations smooth over long periods.

        Think of it like this: If you had enough money to purchase a new Honda
        today, and you invested that money:

      6. Invest In Stocks Because They Are Easy To Understand and, Invest
    </h3>
    <div class="space-y-3">
      <p>
        If you are blessed enough to possess a substantial amount of money, you
        will likely encounter difficulty determining where to invest. So many
        ideas are desirable. For example, you could invest in real estate,
        invest in bonds, start a business, or yet invest in precious coins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then again, stocks are lenient to invest. You need to sign up with an
        online trading broker like
        <a href="https://fidelity.com/">Fidelity</a>,
        <a href="https://vanguard.com">Vanguard</a>,
        <a href="https://etrade.com">E*TRADE</a>, or
        <a href="https://schwab.com/">Charles Schwab</a>, learn the basics, and
        savvy some practical experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to real investing in real estate or business, the learning
        curve for stocks is low. Stocks are also cheap to trade relative to
        other investments. It's no surprise stocks are referred to as "liquid
        assets" since stocks can be easily turned into cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you invested $1,000 in the stock market at 9 am. Then at 3 pm,
        you decide to cash out. You only need a few clicks then you will have
        turned that thousand dollars into cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparatively, illiquid assets can not be easily converted to cash. For
        example, suppose you had a Maserati that you needed to convert to cash.
        Depending on your marketing strategies, you could use up weeks or months
        hunting the right buyer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many investors invest in stocks since they can cash out easily if need
        be.

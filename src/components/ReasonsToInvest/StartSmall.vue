        Retail brokers today have opted to provide their clients with gentle
        ways to join the investment industry. Retail brokers such as
        <a href="https://schwab.com/">Charles Schwab</a> allow you to buy and
        sell stocks commission-free.
        <a href="https://fidelity.com/">Fidelity</a>
        does not require account minimums. Depending on the broker, if the stock
        you desire is too expensive, you can also purchase fractional shares.

        Investors can now start purchasing stocks for less than 100 dollars.

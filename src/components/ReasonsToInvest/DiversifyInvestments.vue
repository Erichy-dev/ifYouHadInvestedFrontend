        It's often wise to avoid placing all eggs in the same basket. Stocks
        allow you to diversify your investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose you have a full-time job, do handy work on the
        weekends, rent an extra room in your house to a college student, and
        invest in dividend stocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were to injure your right hand such that you could not do handy
        work on the weekends, you wouldn't lose your income. The other two
        sources of income would still help you pull through.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same concept applies to stocks. Diversification helps you invest in
        different assets to diffuse your risk. If one stock loses, the other
        stock brings in profits so that your entire portfolio is protected.

            >Diversify through Mutual Funds and ETFs.</span
          >
          Investing in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grants you
          the chance to own hundreds of stocks selected by the fund manager. One
          promiscuous way to diversify is through index funds or index ETFs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Diversify by Location.</span> Why not
          invest in a company in the United States, Europe, Japan, Kenya, and
          emerging markets? Diversifying allows you to curb the opportunity to
          take advantage of blooming economies without being vulnerable to any
          single geography.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Diversify by Company Size.</span>
          There are three types of companies based on size: small-cap, mid-cap,
          and large-cap(the term cap means capitalization). Capitalization is
          the total stock price multiplied by the number of shares. It's wise to
          consider different-sized companies when investing. Large-cap companies
          are stable and less open to sharing price volatility. Comparatively,
          small-cap companies are susceptible to share price volatility but
          offer more growth potential.

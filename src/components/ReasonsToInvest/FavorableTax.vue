        The government has furnished various tax-free accounts that allow you to
        legally avoid tax on your investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoiding taxes make a clear-cut difference in how much money you earn
        from your investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the more money you invest, the more you gain from tax-free
        investments. However, you typically have to invest in stocks or similar
        investments such as mutual funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, if you trade your stock at a loss the government will give
        you a tax break. If you trade your stock at a profit, you will have to
        pay a small fee called capital gains taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some governments offer complete leniency on dividend stocks. Therefore,
        you will not incur any tax cut on your investments.

        Mainly, investors intend to buy low and then sell high. For example,
        investing in a fast-growing company. That's lucrative to both
        buy-and-hold investors and day traders. The first group intends to see
        the company's earnings and stock price bloom over time. The latter
        expects to capitalize on short-term trends. Both investors believe their
        stock analysis guarantees profits.

        Moreover, other investors opt for a steady stream of cash. These
        investors buy stocks of companies that give dividends. Generally, these
        companies grow at a moderate rate. However, not all companies offer
        dividends.

        So you can choose between investing in stocks at a low price and then
        cashing out with profits when the stock price grows. Or you can choose
        to buy stocks from companies that offer dividends.

        Historically, stock prices tend to rise in the long run. There have been
        cruddy crashes, drawbacks, and periods of poor performance. However,
        stocks tend to form a steady march upward as the economies grow.

        For example, if you had merely one single dollar invested in the shares
        of small companies in 1926, you would be worth approximately 40,000
        dollars today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most investors invest in stocks since they believe the market will
        thrive over time.

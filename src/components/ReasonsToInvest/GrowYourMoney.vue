      <p>Of course, this is the profound reason every investor buys stocks.</p>
      <p>
        Long-term equity returns have always been more beneficial than returns
        from cash and bonds. Nevertheless, stock prices seem to rise and fall
        over time. Therefore, most investors favor a long-term perspective for
        their equity portfolio because stock-market fluctuations smooth over
        long periods.

        Done right, you stand to manifold your investment by approximately 7% to
        10% per year in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose you invested $10,000 into the stock market. The
        stock value grows by 7% per year. In 10 years, you would have raised
        your 10,000 dollars into 20,000 dollars.

      <p>
        Moreover, suppose you invested 10,000 dollars every year for 30 years.
        If you calculate, you would have invested 300,000 dollars into the
        stock. Surprisingly, you would have gained 1,010,730. An interest of
        710,730 dollars. You would have been a millionaire without even lifting
        a finger.
